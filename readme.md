# E-commerce Product Dashboard (Backend-Focused)

Backend-driven product management application built using **FastAPI** with a simple **Streamlit** frontend for interaction.  
This project focuses on clean API design, service-layer architecture, and practical backend development patterns.

## What I Built
- RESTful APIs using FastAPI to support product CRUD operations, filtering, pagination, and sorting
- Service-layer design separating API routes from data handling logic
- Streamlit frontend to interact with backend APIs for product management

## Tech Stack
FastAPI · Streamlit · Python · REST APIs · JSON (file-based storage)

## Design Notes
- File-based storage is used for simplicity and learning purposes
- Backend logic is decoupled from storage, allowing easy migration to a database (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- Architecture supports future ML or GenAI feature integration
